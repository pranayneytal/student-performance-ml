# Student Performance Prediction (ML)

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on academic and demographic features using machine learning.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Type
Binary Classification (Pass / Fail)

## Dataset
Student performance dataset containing exam scores and background features.

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

## Future Improvements
- Try different models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
